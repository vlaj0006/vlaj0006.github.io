        <p>My name is Ana Vlajich. I am 18 years old and was born on March 16<sup>th</sup>. I am Serbian but have lived in Canada all my life. Something that interests me is digital media art. I specifically enjoy films and cinematography. My favourite movies are <em>Whiplash</em> and <em>Mid 90s</em>. In the future I hope to be a part of movie productions in some point in my life.</p>

        <p>I took this <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program to figure out which direction i'd like to go into in the future. I am looking forward to <abbr title="Web development">Web Dev</abbr> since I'd like to understand code better. In general, I just <em>really</em> love all digital media and am extremely intrigued by technology, I'm hoping to better my understanding and expand my knowledge throughout my time in this program. </p>
